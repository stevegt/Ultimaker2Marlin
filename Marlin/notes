firmware 14.04.1-stevegt1:
==========================

bed height grounded: 27.4
bed height after first (and later) G28:  29.4

bed height when switch opens (moving upward):  30.1
bed height when switch closes (moving downward):  29.4

Am able to home, then M18, push bed down, M17, then G1 F10 Z205; e.g.
limit switch closed doesn't prevent Z move.
